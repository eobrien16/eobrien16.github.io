  <h3>ShellTer</h3>
  <p>ShellTer is a (soon to be deprecated)Launcher for shell scripts. If you want to use it then you can find the installer
    <a href="https://github.com/NightVisionGroup/shellter/blob/master/Installer.sh">here</a> but I am currently working on a
    Java version that will be released soon. Update: The java version of shellter has been deprecated. The ShellTer project has been indefinitely postponed.</p>
  <br />
  <h3>Custom JBME?</h3>
  <p>Starting working on that now. Should be up soon enough</p>
  <br />
  <h3>Repo?</h3>
  <p>You can find my repo <a href="cydia://url/https://cydia.saurik.com/api/share#?source=https://jailbrek.me/repo/">here. It currently only contains "iOS 6: Raw", the first theme created by the ThemeBois.</p>
